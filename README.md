Mars Rover Project

The main functionality for this project lies within the movement services in the Services folder of the project structure.

To test this, please run the project in either http or https mode (The environment I added only has the http link in as thats what I did my testing with due to some issues trusting the https certificate)
Once you have the project running please open the postman collection I have included in this project which contains a list of tests that should prove that the application works as expected.

I would have added some unit testing to this but I got asked to complete this in as close to one hour as I could and I focussed on the functionality.


Thank you for taking the time to look at this project.
